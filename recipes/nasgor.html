        <h3>Wait, Isn't That Just Fried Rice? Always Have Been</h3>
        <p>
            Nasi goreng is Indonesian fried rice, I mean it literally means fried 
            rice in Bahasa Indonesia. What's the difference you might ask? Well, 
            nasi goreng uses sweet soy sauce in its ingredients. Sweet soy sauce is 
            pretty much a staple in nasi goreng, a soy sauce that's native to Indonesia.
            Sweet soy sauce's consistency is thicker than a regula soy sauce. So basically 
            nasi goreng is just a fried rice mixed with sweet soy sauce, THAT'S IT!!

            Generally speaking, fried rice is very customizable. You can have variety 
            of different toppings. But for this recipe's sake, we'll use shrip and egg 
            as the main topping, feel free to add whatever you like! Nasi goreng gives 
            you a sense of adventure whenever you try different toppings. We 
            recommend you to experiment with your dish.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of leftover rice if possibel, newly cooked rice is fine</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of sweet soy sauce</li>
            <li>150 g of clean shrimps</li>
            <li>2-3 eggs (you can add sunny side fried egg for individual serving)</li>
            <li>1 diced onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 tsp red chilli</li>
            <li>1 chopped shallot</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp shrimp paste (for immersive experience, but optional)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the oil over high heat in a large skillet or wok 
                (preferably wok since we need that asian authenticity).
            </li>
            <li>Add chilli and garlic, stir for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add onion and shallot, cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>
                Add shrimps, cook until they mostly turn pinkish-white, then add 
                1 tbsp sweet soy sauce and cook until shrimps are mostly cooked 
                through and a bit caramelised.
            </li>
            <li>Add 2 eggs and scramble them nicely. This should only take 10 seconds</li>
            <li>
                Add rice, 2 tbsp sweet soy sauce, oyster sauce, and shrimp paste, if using. 
                Stir constantly, for 2 minutes until sauce reduces down and 
                rice grains start to caramelise. Then add salt according to your 
                taste, mix well so the salt will spread evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and serve the dish in a plate</li>
            <li>
                Cook a sunny side fried egg with runny yolk (yum!!) to add on top 
                of the serving. This is optional but a must if you want 
                the authentic nasi goreng experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                For garnish you can add sliced tomatoes and cucumber, saut√©ed bok choy, 
                or what ever veggies you like. Also add indonesian fish or shrimp cracker 
                if available.
            </li>
            <li>Don't just stare at it, EAT IT!! Don't forget to stab the egg yolk first hehe.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Feel free to try different variations. This is fried rice after all, the dish is 
            your playground. For example, you can use sausage instead of shrimp, or you can add 
            chicken, and so on. It feels like there are flavors that are waiting to be discovered, 
            just like hunting for treasures, so have fun!
