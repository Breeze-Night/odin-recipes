        <h3>Mentai? Sounds Awfully a Lot Like the Word That Starts with H</h3>
        <p>
            Basically, this dish is just baked salmon and rice with mentai 
            sauce. Mentai or mentaiko (明太子) is seasoned pollack roe, the 
            roe of Alaska pollack (roe is fish eggs in case you don't know). 
            There are different variations of mentaiko. You can see mentaiko 
            sold in different colors that range from pink to bright red, the 
            redder it gets, the spicier it is.

            This dish will capture the taste of the ocean in your tiny little mouth. 
            When eating this, it will feel like as if you are swimming with a 
            school of fish exploring the vast sea. Do you want that experience? You 
            can make it in the comfort of your own kitchen!!

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, we make the butter sauce. Prepare a bowl, pour all the 
                ingredients for the sauce into it. Mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the rice with nori powder, soy sauce, and sesame oil. 
                Mix well.
            </li>

            <li>
                Transfer the rice to a heat-resistant dish or you can also use 
                aluminum foil packaging. Spread the rice, set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now it's time to process salmon. Separate salmon meat and skin. 
                Then cut the salmon into thin slices to size according to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the salmon with soy sauce until smooth, then arrange the salmon 
                into a baking pan. Bake briefly using a blow torch until the surface 
                changes color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange the salmon on the rice surface, pour the mentai sauce over 
                the salmon until it is even and add cheddar cheese if you want that 
                cheesy sensation. Covers the entire surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the surface of the mentai sauce with a blow torch until it turns brown. 
                If you don't have a blow tourch you can bake it in the oven for 20 minutes 
                in 180°C. Add nori powder or parsley on top as garnish.
            </li>
            <li>Pat yourself on the back and enjoy the food, Itadakimasu! </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The beauty of this dish is that you can make variations how ever you like!! 
            Instead of using salmon, you can use beef, chicken, crab, or even make it 
            vegan by replacing the fish roe with seaweed caviar, the choice is yours!
